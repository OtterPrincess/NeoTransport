Nestara Replit Interface Design – Product Detail View

Overview

This document outlines the Replit-based front-end interface component for Nestara, designed to allow clinical staff and technicians to view full bed product details—similar to how McMaster-Carr shows detailed product specs.

Goal

Enable users to click "View Details" from a Nestara bed alert card or Teams message and be taken to a dedicated product detail view where all relevant specifications, logs, and history for that specific bed are easily accessible.
