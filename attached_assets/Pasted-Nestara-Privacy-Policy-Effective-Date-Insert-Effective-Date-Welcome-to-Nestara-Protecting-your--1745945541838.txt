Nestara Privacy Policy
Effective Date: [Insert Effective Date]

Welcome to Nestara. Protecting your privacy and safeguarding your information are central to how we design and operate our services. This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect, how we use it, and the rights and choices you have.

We encourage you to read it carefully.

1. Scope
This Privacy Policy applies to all information collected by Nestara through our website, communications, applications, prototypes, physical devices, and any related services (the “Services”).

Nestara is committed to maintaining the highest standards of privacy, especially given the sensitive nature of maternal, neonatal, and healthcare-related information.

2. Information We Collect
We limit data collection to only what is necessary to provide and improve our Services.
Depending on your interaction with Nestara, we may collect:

Personal Information (only if voluntarily provided):

Name, email address, organization/affiliation

Professional role or relationship to neonatal care (if applicable)

Health-Related Information:

We do not collect protected health information (PHI) under HIPAA unless explicitly stated and consented to under a separate agreement.

Device Information:

If using a Nestara prototype device, we may collect non-identifiable operational metrics such as device uptime, temperature readings, or shock/vibration measurements.

No personally identifiable data is transmitted from device monitoring functions unless separately and expressly consented to.

Communications:

Emails, survey responses, or feedback voluntarily submitted to us.

Website Analytics:

Basic non-identifiable information (browser type, visit duration, pages visited) via privacy-centric analytics tools.

We do not use invasive cookies or third-party trackers unless necessary for core functionality.

3. How We Use Your Information
We use your information to:

Operate, maintain, and improve our Services

Communicate with you about your participation, inquiries, or feedback

Develop research, prototypes, and improvements in neonatal care and maternal health technologies

Comply with legal obligations

We do not sell, rent, or trade your information to third parties.

4. Data Storage and Security
Information is stored using secure, access-controlled systems.

Any sensitive prototypes or data are handled with an offline-first mindset whenever possible to reduce exposure risks.

We implement physical, technical, and administrative safeguards appropriate to the sensitivity of the information we manage.

In case of third-party cloud services, we use only reputable vendors compliant with applicable security standards (e.g., SOC 2, HIPAA-compliant providers where necessary).

5. Sharing of Information
We only share information:

With your explicit consent

With partners or collaborators directly involved in developing Nestara products or services, under confidentiality agreements

If legally required (e.g., lawful court orders or subpoenas)

We require all collaborators and vendors to adhere to strict confidentiality and security standards.

6. Children's Privacy
Nestara does not knowingly collect information directly from children under the age of 18.
Where applicable, our products are intended to support caregivers, families, and healthcare providers—not to directly engage or collect data from minors.

7. Your Rights and Choices
Depending on your jurisdiction, you may have the right to:

Access the information we hold about you

Correct or update your information

Request deletion of your information

Object to or restrict certain types of data use

8. Changes to this Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our practices or legal requirements.
