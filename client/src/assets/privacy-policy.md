# Nestara Privacy Policy
**Effective Date: April 29, 2025**

Welcome to Nestara. Protecting your privacy and safeguarding your information are central to how we design and operate our services. This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect, how we use it, and the rights and choices you have.

We encourage you to read it carefully.

## 1. Scope
This Privacy Policy applies to all information collected by Nestara through our website, communications, applications, prototypes, physical devices, and any related services (the "Services").

Nestara is committed to maintaining the highest standards of privacy, especially given the sensitive nature of maternal, neonatal, and healthcare-related information.

## 2. Information We Collect

Depending on your interaction with Nestara, we may collect:

**Personal Information** (only if voluntarily provided):
- Name, email address, organization/affiliation
- Professional role or relationship to neonatal care (if applicable)

**Health-Related Information**:
- We do not collect protected health information (PHI) under HIPAA unless explicitly stated and consented to under a separate agreement.

**Device Information**:
- If using a Nestara prototype device, we may collect non-identifiable operational metrics such as device uptime, temperature readings, or shock/vibration measurements.
- No personally identifiable data is transmitted from device monitoring functions unless separately and expressly consented to.

**Communications**:
- Emails, survey responses, or feedback voluntarily submitted to us.

**Website Analytics and Security Information**:
- Basic non-identifiable information (browser type, visit duration, pages visited) via privacy-centric analytics tools.
- IP address and related network information for security purposes, threat detection, and service improvement.
- We do not use invasive cookies or third-party trackers unless necessary for core functionality.

## 3. How We Use Your Information

- Detect and prevent potential security threats, unauthorized access, or fraudulent activity
- Comply with legal obligations

We do not sell, rent, or trade your information to third parties.

## 4. Data Storage and Security
- Information is stored using secure, access-controlled systems.
- Any sensitive prototypes or data are handled with an offline-first mindset whenever possible to reduce exposure risks.
- We implement physical, technical, and administrative safeguards appropriate to the sensitivity of the information we manage.
- We utilize security monitoring systems to protect against unauthorized access and potential threats.
- In case of third-party cloud services, we use only reputable vendors compliant with applicable security standards (e.g., SOC 2, HIPAA-compliant providers where necessary).

## 5. Network Security and IP Address Usage
To protect our Services and users, we:
- Automatically collect and analyze IP addresses and related network information
- Monitor for suspicious activity patterns that may indicate security threats
- Apply security measures based on threat assessment, which may include rate limiting or blocking suspicious traffic
- Store IP-related security data in a dedicated, secured database with access limited to authorized personnel
- Classify and respond to potential threats in accordance with industry best practices
- Maintain records of security events for incident response and service improvement

**Geolocation Information**: 
- When necessary for security purposes, we may process approximate location data derived from IP addresses.
- This information is used solely for security verification and threat detection.

## 6. Sharing of Information
We only share information:
- With your explicit consent
- With partners or collaborators directly involved in developing Nestara products or services, under confidentiality agreements
- If legally required (e.g., lawful court orders or subpoenas)

We require all collaborators and vendors to adhere to strict confidentiality and security standards.

## 7. Children's Privacy
Nestara does not knowingly collect information directly from children under the age of 18.

## 8. Data Retention
We retain information as long as necessary to:
- Provide and maintain our Services
- Comply with legal obligations
- Resolve disputes
- Enforce agreements

Security-related information, including IP addresses and threat detection data, may be retained for longer periods as necessary to maintain platform security and integrity.
